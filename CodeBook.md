The output file has the first three columns:

* activity_label - the meaningful name for the particular activity
* acitivity_id - the numeric code for the particular activity
* subject_id - the id of the particular subject

All other columns are labelled as per the original code book but each column represents the mean of that observation for the particular subject and activity
